		<p>My name is Miles Kong. I graduated from Rutgers University with a degree in Kinesiology which is the study of body mechanics.  I have always had a passion/affinity in helping others, and for a long time I thought the medical filed was my calling. After lots of thought, I decided to put health care in the back seat for the time being and pursue a new career in computer science.My hobbies include traveling, fishing, hiking, camping, football, and basketball.  My all time favorite trip was visiting Montana and Wyoming this past summer</p>
