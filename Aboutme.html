		<h2>About Me</h2>
		<p> My name is Miles Kong. I graduated from Rutgers University with a degree in Kinesiology which is the study of body mechanics.  I have always had a passion/affinity in helping others, and for a long time I thought the medical filed was my calling. After lots of thought, I decided to put health care in the back set for the time being and pursue a new career in computer science.
